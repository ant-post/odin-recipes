        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch.
            <br> Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>

        <!-- <br> -->
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- <br> -->
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic;
                <br> cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to
                <br> ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with
                <br> lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to
                <br> desired consistency, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve
                <br> immediately.</li>
        </ol>
